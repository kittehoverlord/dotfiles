# dotfiles
various settings for my system
xmobar v0.19
xmonad v0.11
GNU + Mint Linux 17.1
Bash 4.3.11

The Preperations for my move to GNU + Funtoo Linux are underway.  My xmobar version will switch to the one located here on github, v.23, so I may need to rework those files some in order to attain the same look and feel.  The newer version does seem to make use easier and configuration more robust.  I have yet to give it a shot. My hiatus from GNU + Linux was long enough for me to forget most things,  but short enough for me to be able to easily relearn them.
